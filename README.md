# PathFinderAlgorithm
Find path between two points between two coordinates on ASCII file
The first two rows are coordinates. The coordinates are given in x,y format. 
In map the '.' is free land, 'X' is a tree and 'O' (big o not a zero) is a rock.
The path can not walk through trees or rocks and must go around them. We count the trees wich we walk by.
